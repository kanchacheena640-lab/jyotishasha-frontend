  nature: `
Aquarius Nature – The Visionary Rebel  
Aquarius is the sign of the future. Ruled by Uranus (innovation) and Saturn (structure), you are the zodiac’s true original—a blend of brilliant intellect and eccentric charm. You don’t follow trends; you set them. You possess a humanitarian heart and a mind that operates on a completely different frequency than the rest of the world. You value independence and intellectual freedom above all else. Your journey is about breaking boundaries, challenging the status quo, and proving that being "different" is actually your greatest superpower.

  love: `
Aquarius Love – Intellectual Intimacy  
In love, Aquarius seeks a "Meeting of the Minds" before a meeting of the hearts. For you, friendship is the ultimate foundation for romance. You aren't interested in traditional roles or clingy dynamics; you need a partner who is also your best friend and respects your need for space. You express love through stimulating conversation, shared ideals, and giving your partner the freedom to be themselves. While you may seem emotionally detached at times, your loyalty is deep for anyone who can keep your mind engaged and your spirit free.

  finance: `
Aquarius Finance – The Tech-Savvy Investor  
For Aquarius, money is a tool for innovation and social impact. You are often drawn to unconventional career paths—think tech, social media, science, or community-led projects. You have a natural instinct for future trends, which makes you excellent at spotting "the next big thing" in investments. While you aren't motivated by greed, you appreciate the freedom that wealth provides. Your financial success comes from your ability to collaborate with like-minded people and your courage to invest in ideas that others think are "too crazy" to work.
