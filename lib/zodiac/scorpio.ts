  nature: `
Scorpio Nature – The Alchemist of Shadows
Scorpio is the powerhouse of the zodiac. Ruled by Pluto (transformation) and Mars (action), your presence is felt long before you speak. You possess a rare, magnetic intensity and an "X-ray vision" that allows you to see the truth behind any facade. You aren't interested in surface-level small talk; you crave depth, mystery, and authenticity. You are fiercely resilient, capable of reinventing yourself from the ashes like a phoenix. Your journey is about mastering your immense emotional power and using your focus to achieve what others deem impossible.

  love: `
Scorpio Love – All-Consuming Devotion
In love, Scorpio is "all or nothing." You don't just date; you merge. Your approach to romance is deep, soulful, and incredibly private. You seek a partner who isn't afraid of your intensity—someone who values loyalty as much as life itself. Trust is your currency; once earned, you are the most protective and devoted partner in the zodiac. While you can be mysterious and guarded at first, your love is a transformative force that offers a level of intimacy and spiritual connection that few other signs can match.

  finance: `
Scorpio Finance – The Strategic Power Player
For Scorpio, money is power and a tool for transformation. You are a natural investigator, making you excellent at spotting hidden financial opportunities, investments, or market trends that others miss. You have a "poker face" when it comes to business dealings, allowing you to negotiate from a position of strength. You are often drawn to careers in research, psychology, finance, or anything that requires deep focus. Your financial success comes from your ability to stay patient, keep your plans private, and strike only when the timing is perfect.
