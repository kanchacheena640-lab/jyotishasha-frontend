    intro:
      "Neechbhang Rajyog is a powerful concept in Vedic astrology that explains how a debilitated planet can regain strength and even produce positive, Raja-yoga–like results. This yoga shows that debilitation alone does not decide failure; cancellation conditions are equally important.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Neechbhang occurs when a planet placed in its debilitation sign gets cancellation due to specific classical conditions. These include the lord of the debilitation sign being in a Kendra, mutual exchange, conjunction with exalted planets, or strong angular placement.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Neechbhang Rajyog must be judged primarily from Lagna and supported by Moon chart and dasha timing. A cancelled debilitation gives results only when the planet is activated through its dasha or antardasha.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Neechbhang Rajyog tool checks all classical Neechbhang conditions as defined in Parashari astrology. It evaluates the planet’s debilitation, cancellation rules, house strength, and supporting factors to determine whether true Neechbhang Rajyog exists.",

    benefits: [
      "Identifies genuine Neechbhang Rajyog conditions",
      "Explains why a weak planet may still give success",
      "Helps avoid incorrect negative judgments of kundali",
      "Useful for career, authority, and life-rise analysis",
      "Based strictly on classical Vedic astrology logic",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Neechbhang Rajyog does not give instant results. It often indicates delayed success after struggle. The timing of results depends on planetary periods and overall chart strength rather than mere presence of the yoga.",

      q: "Can a debilitated planet still give good results?",
      a: "Yes. If classical Neechbhang conditions are present, the planet can give positive outcomes, often after struggle.",

      q: "When does Neechbhang Rajyog give results?",
