    intro:
      "Panch Mahapurush Yog is a group of five powerful yogas described in classical Vedic astrology. These yogas are formed when certain planets occupy their own or exaltation signs in Kendra houses. They indicate exceptional strength, authority, talent, and leadership qualities.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "The five Mahapurush Yogas are formed by Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. Each yoga represents a distinct type of greatness based on the planet involved and reflects strong personality traits, professional success, and influence in life.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Panch Mahapurush Yog is primarily evaluated from the Lagna chart. The Moon chart and dasha timing are then used to confirm when and how strongly the yoga will manifest. A yoga present in the chart may remain dormant until activated by planetary periods.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Panch Mahapurush Yog tool checks whether Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, or Saturn are placed in their own or exalted signs in Kendra houses. It validates the formation according to Parashari rules and presents only genuine Mahapurush Yog combinations.",

    benefits: [
      "Identifies all five Mahapurush Yogas accurately",
      "Avoids false or exaggerated yoga claims",
      "Helps understand leadership and authority potential",
      "Useful for career, status, and long-term success analysis",
      "Based on classical Vedic astrology principles",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Even strong Mahapurush Yogas do not give results automatically. Planetary strength, aspects, afflictions, and dasha timing decide whether the yoga produces exceptional success or remains moderate in expression.",
