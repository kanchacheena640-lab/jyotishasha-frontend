    intro:
      "Sade Sati is a significant Saturn transit period in Vedic astrology that affects a person for approximately seven and a half years. It begins when Saturn transits the sign before the Moon sign, continues over the Moon sign, and ends after Saturn leaves the next sign.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Sade Sati is linked entirely to the Moon sign (Chandra Rashi), not the Sun sign. Saturn’s movement around the Moon influences emotional stability, responsibilities, discipline, and life structure. It is a karmic phase meant for growth, not punishment.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Since the Moon represents the mind and emotional state, Saturn’s transit near the Moon tests patience, maturity, and inner strength. Results of Sade Sati vary greatly depending on Saturn’s strength, chart dignity, and ongoing dasha periods.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Sade Sati Calculator identifies your Moon sign using birth details and checks Saturn’s current transit. It determines whether Sade Sati is active, upcoming, or completed, and clearly indicates the current phase if applicable.",

    sunVsMoonRashi:
