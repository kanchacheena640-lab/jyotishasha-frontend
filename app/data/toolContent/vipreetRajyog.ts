    intro:
      "Vipreet Rajyog is a unique and powerful yoga in Vedic astrology where success arises through difficulties, losses, or challenging situations. Unlike regular Rajyogs, its results often appear after struggle and unexpected turns in life.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Vipreet Rajyog is formed when the lords of the 6th, 8th, or 12th houses occupy each other’s houses or become strongly placed. These houses represent obstacles, transformations, and losses, but when interconnected properly, they reverse negativity into strength.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "The Moon chart plays an important role in Vipreet Rajyog as it shows emotional resilience. Mental strength and adaptability are key factors in converting difficulties into long-term success.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Vipreet Rajyog tool analyzes the placement and strength of the 6th, 8th, and 12th house lords using classical Parashari astrology rules. It also checks planetary dignity, afflictions, and timing factors before confirming the yoga.",

    benefits: [
      "Identifies authentic Vipreet Rajyog in kundali",
      "Explains success arising after struggles or setbacks",
      "Helps understand sudden rise, recovery, or reversal of fate",

      "Strictly follows classical Vedic astrology principles",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Vipreet Rajyog does not give early or easy success. Its results are usually experienced during the dasha of the involved planets, often after a phase of hardship that transforms into stability and recognition.",
