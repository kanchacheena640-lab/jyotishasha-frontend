    intro:
      "Getting a government job requires discipline, patience, stability, and long-term effort. In Vedic astrology, government service is not random—it is clearly indicated by specific planets, houses, and yogas in the birth chart.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Government job potential is mainly seen through the 6th house (competition and service), 10th house (career), and the Sun which represents authority, administration, and government power. Strong Saturn supports discipline and long service.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Moon Rashi reflects mental strength, emotional stability, and persistence. Competitive exams and long preparation phases require a stable Moon to handle pressure, delays, and repeated attempts.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Government Job tool analyzes your birth chart focusing on the Sun, Saturn, 6th house, 10th house, and their lords. It also evaluates ongoing Mahadasha and Antardasha periods to determine realistic timing and chances.",

    benefits: [
      "Helps assess suitability for government or public sector jobs",
      "Analyzes success in competitive exams and selection processes",
      "Identifies strong and weak planetary periods for preparation",
      "Explains delays, failures, or repeated attempts logically",
      "Based on authentic classical Vedic astrology principles",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Even with strong government job yogas, results are delivered mainly during supportive dashas of the Sun, Saturn, or 10th/6th house lords. Timing plays a critical role in final selection.",
