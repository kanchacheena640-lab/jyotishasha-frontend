    intro:
      "In Vedic astrology, planets (Grahas) are the core forces that shape a person’s life. Each planet represents specific qualities, responsibilities, and life areas. Understanding planetary roles helps in interpreting personality traits, life events, and future trends accurately.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Planets in Vedic astrology are cosmic energies that influence human life through their placement, strength, and timing. There are nine main planets—Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu—each governing different aspects of life.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "The effect of planets is always judged in relation to Lagna (Ascendant) and Moon Rashi. While Lagna shows physical and life direction, Moon reflects mental and emotional responses. Planetary results become meaningful only when analyzed through these two references.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Planet Overview tool analyzes your birth chart and presents a structured overview of all nine planets. It highlights their sign placement, house position, and natural significations, giving you a clear understanding of planetary influences in your kundali.",

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Planetary meanings remain constant, but their results change based on sign, house, and dasha. A strong planet gives positive results, while a weak or afflicted planet may require remedies. Therefore, planets should never be judged in isolation.",
