    whatIsRashi:
      "This yoga is formed when the lords of the 9th house (fortune, dharma, higher guidance) and the 10th house (career, profession, actions) are connected through conjunction, mutual aspect, or exchange. Such a connection aligns effort with luck.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "While Dharma Karmadhipati Yog is primarily judged from the Lagna chart, the Moon chart shows mental strength and emotional stability required to handle authority, responsibility, and public roles.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Dharma Karmadhipati Yog tool analyzes the relationship between the 9th and 10th house lords using classical Parashari rules. It checks planetary dignity, strength, and affliction before confirming the yoga.",
