    intro:
      "Chandra Mangal Yog is a well-known wealth-giving yoga in Vedic astrology. It is formed by the association of the Moon and Mars and indicates strong financial instincts, business ability, and the drive to accumulate resources. However, its results depend heavily on planetary strength and control over emotions.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Chandra Mangal Yog is formed when Moon and Mars are placed together in the same house or aspect each other. The Moon represents the mind and emotional intelligence, while Mars signifies action, courage, and initiative. Their combination creates financial drive and decision-making power.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Since the Moon plays a direct role in this yoga, emotional stability is crucial. A strong Moon with controlled Mars gives business acumen and wealth creation, while afflictions can lead to impulsive decisions and financial ups and downs.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Chandra Mangal Yog tool checks the positional relationship between Moon and Mars, evaluates their dignity, house placement, and afflictions, and determines whether a genuine and effective Chandra Mangal Yog exists in the birth chart.",

    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Chandra Mangal Yog does not guarantee instant wealth. Its results depend on planetary strength, discipline, and timing. When balanced, it supports financial growth; when afflicted, it can cause instability despite opportunities.",
