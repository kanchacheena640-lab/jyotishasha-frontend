    intro:
      "Dhan Yog refers to specific planetary combinations in Vedic astrology that indicate financial potential, income generation, and material prosperity. These yogas show the ability to earn, save, and grow wealth, but they do not promise effortless riches without action or timing.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Dhan Yog is formed through the relationship between wealth-related houses (2nd, 5th, 9th, 11th) and their lords, along with benefic planets like Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury. Strong house lords and favorable associations create stable and sustainable wealth yogas.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "While Dhan Yog is mainly judged from Lagna, the Moon chart reflects financial mindset and spending behavior. A person may have strong earning yogas but still struggle if emotional discipline and financial judgment are weak.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Dhan Yog tool analyzes your kundali for classical wealth combinations, checks the strength of wealth houses and planets, and evaluates whether the yogas are supported by planetary dignity and timing rather than listing superficial combinations.",

    benefits: [
      "Identifies genuine Dhan Yog combinations",
      "Helps understand earning and saving capacity",
      "Useful for career, business, and financial planning",
      "Avoids misleading ‘instant wealth’ claims",
      "Based on authentic Vedic astrology principles",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Dhan Yog does not guarantee lifelong wealth. Its results depend on effort, discipline, and dasha timing. Strong yogas give opportunities, while weak or afflicted yogas require careful financial planning and remedies.",
