    intro:
      "Foreign travel and overseas settlement are strongly indicated in a birth chart through specific houses and planetary combinations. Vedic astrology helps identify whether travel abroad will be temporary, frequent, or lead to long-term settlement.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Foreign travel is primarily seen through the 12th house (foreign lands, isolation), 9th house (long journeys), and 3rd house (movement). The involvement of Rahu, Moon, or the lords of these houses strengthens the chances of going abroad.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Moon Rashi reflects adaptability, emotional comfort, and mental readiness for life away from homeland. A supportive Moon helps adjust to foreign environments, cultures, and lifestyles.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Foreign Travel tool analyzes the 9th and 12th houses, their lords, Rahu influence, planetary aspects, and active dasha periods. It determines the likelihood, nature, and timing of foreign travel using classical Vedic astrology rules.",

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Foreign travel results are strongly linked to planetary dashas. Major travel or relocation usually occurs when the dasha of the 9th, 12th house lord, or Rahu becomes active.",
