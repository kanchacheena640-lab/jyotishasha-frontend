    intro:
      "Grah Dasha plays a crucial role in Vedic astrology by defining the timing of events in a person’s life. Many people experience changes without understanding which planetary period is influencing them. Grah Dasha Finder helps identify the current Mahadasha and Antardasha running in your life.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Grah Dasha refers to the planetary time periods that operate according to the Vimshottari Dasha system. Each Mahadasha is ruled by a planet and is further divided into Antardashas, which refine the results and timing of events.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "The Moon’s position at birth determines the starting point of the Vimshottari Dasha cycle. Because of this, accurate Grah Dasha calculation requires precise birth details, especially date, time, and place of birth.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Grah Dasha Finder calculates your Vimshottari Dasha sequence using your birth details. It identifies your current Mahadasha and Antardasha along with their time periods, based on classical Vedic astrology rules.",
