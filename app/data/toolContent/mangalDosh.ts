    intro:
      "Mangal Dosh, also known as Manglik Dosha, is a common astrological condition discussed in Vedic astrology, especially in relation to marriage. It is caused by the placement of Mars (Mangal) in certain houses of the birth chart. However, the presence of Mangal Dosh does not automatically mean problems in marriage.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Mangal Dosh occurs when Mars is placed in specific houses such as the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th, or 12th house from Lagna or Moon. Mars represents energy, aggression, and passion. When improperly placed, it can create imbalance in marital harmony.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Mangal Dosh must be checked from both Lagna (Ascendant) and Moon chart. Many cancellations and exceptions apply depending on sign placement, conjunctions, aspects, and planetary strength. Judging Manglik status without these factors leads to incorrect conclusions.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Mangal Dosh tool analyzes Mars placement from Lagna and Moon, checks applicable dosha rules, and evaluates cancellations (Dosha Bhanga). The result gives a clear, practical understanding rather than a fear-based Manglik label.",

    benefits: [
      "Accurate Manglik Dosha detection",
      "Checks cancellation rules automatically",
      "Avoids unnecessary fear regarding marriage",
      "Useful for marriage compatibility analysis",
      "Based on classical Vedic astrology principles",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Mangal Dosh should never be seen in isolation. The overall strength of Mars, benefic aspects, sign dignity, and matching charts of partners matter far more than the mere presence of Mars in a particular house.",
