    intro:
      "Wearing a gemstone without proper astrological analysis can be ineffective or even harmful. In Vedic astrology, gemstones are prescribed only after examining planetary strength, weakness, and overall chart balance. A correct gemstone works by strengthening beneficial planets, not by blindly copying recommendations.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "A gemstone represents the energy of a specific planet. When worn correctly, it enhances the positive influence of that planet in the birth chart. Each planet has its associated gemstone, such as Ruby for Sun, Pearl for Moon, Yellow Sapphire for Jupiter, and so on.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Gemstone suitability is never decided by Sun sign alone. Lagna, Moon Rashi, planetary dignity, house ownership, and ongoing dasha periods play a critical role. Strengthening the wrong planet can disturb chart balance instead of improving life conditions.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Gemstone Suggestion tool analyzes your full kundali, including planetary strength, house rulership, benefic and malefic influences, and current dasha. Based on this analysis, it suggests gemstones that are safe, supportive, and astrologically beneficial.",

    benefits: [
      "Personalized gemstone recommendation based on kundali",
      "Avoid wearing harmful or unsuitable gemstones",
      "Supports career growth, mental peace, and stability",
      "Useful for remedies without complex rituals",
      "Based on classical Vedic astrology principles",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Gemstones are not universal remedies. The same gemstone can benefit one person and harm another. Therefore, gemstone recommendations must always be kundali-specific and aligned with planetary periods and chart structure.",
