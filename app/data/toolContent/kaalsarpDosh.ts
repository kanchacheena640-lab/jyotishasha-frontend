    intro:
      "Kaalsarp Dosh is a well-known astrological condition associated with Rahu and Ketu. It occurs when all planets in a birth chart are placed between Rahu and Ketu. Over time, this dosha has been misunderstood and often exaggerated, leading to unnecessary fear.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Kaalsarp Dosh forms when Rahu and Ketu occupy opposite houses and all other planets fall within their axis. Rahu represents desires and material obsessions, while Ketu signifies detachment and past-life karma. Their combined axis creates internal pressure and life challenges.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Kaalsarp Dosh must be checked carefully from Lagna and supported by overall chart strength. The presence of benefic planets, strong Moon, Jupiter, or favorable dashas can significantly reduce or nullify its effects. Not every Rahu–Ketu axis forms a harmful Kaalsarp Yog.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Kaalsarp Dosh tool checks planetary placement between Rahu and Ketu, identifies the type of Kaalsarp Yog if present, and evaluates mitigating factors. The result is presented clearly without exaggeration or fear-based interpretation.",

    benefits: [
      "Accurate Kaalsarp Dosh detection",
      "Identifies type of Kaalsarp Yog if present",
      "Avoids fear-based misinformation",
      "Helps understand karmic patterns calmly",
      "Based on classical Vedic astrology logic",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Kaalsarp Dosh does not override the entire birth chart. Strong yogas, benefic aspects, and positive dashas often dominate results. Many successful individuals are born with Kaalsarp Yog, proving that outcomes depend on the full chart, not a single condition.",

    {
      q: "Does Kaalsarp Dosh cause lifelong problems?",
