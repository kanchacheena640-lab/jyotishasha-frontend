      "Lakshmi Yog is a highly auspicious yoga in Vedic astrology associated with wealth, prosperity, comfort, and material stability. This yoga indicates the blessings of Goddess Lakshmi, bringing financial growth and a well-supported lifestyle.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Lakshmi Yog is formed when the lord of the 9th house (fortune and luck) is strong and placed in its own sign, exaltation, or friendly sign, and the Lagna lord is also well placed. The harmony between fortune and self-effort creates this yoga.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "The Moon chart helps assess how well a person can emotionally handle wealth, comfort, and success. A stable Moon supports wise financial decisions and sustained prosperity.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Lakshmi Yog tool analyzes the strength and dignity of the 9th house lord and the Lagna lord using classical Parashari astrology rules. It also checks planetary afflictions and supportive factors before confirming the yoga.",
