    intro:
      "Parashari Rajyog is one of the most respected and authentic yogas described in classical Vedic astrology. These yogas are formed based on the relationship between Kendra (angular) and Trikona (trinal) lords and indicate potential for authority, success, recognition, and rise in life.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "According to Parashara astrology, Rajyog is formed when lords of Kendra (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th houses) and Trikona (1st, 5th, 9th houses) associate through conjunction, mutual aspect, or exchange. The strength of planets and houses determines how powerful the Rajyog will be.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Rajyog should always be evaluated from Lagna primarily, and then supported by Moon chart and Dasha timing. A Rajyog present in the chart does not give results automatically unless it is activated during the appropriate planetary period.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Parashari Rajyog tool scans your birth chart for valid Kendra–Trikona lord combinations as defined by Maharishi Parashara. It evaluates planetary strength, dignity, and association to identify genuine Rajyog formations rather than superficial combinations.",

    benefits: [
      "Identifies authentic Parashari Rajyog combinations",
      "Avoids false or exaggerated Rajyog claims",
      "Helps understand career growth and authority potential",
      "Useful for long-term success and leadership analysis",
      "Based strictly on classical Parashari astrology",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "The presence of Rajyog does not guarantee instant success. Its results depend on dasha, planetary strength, aspects, and overall chart balance. Many people rise gradually through Rajyog rather than sudden elevation.",

    },
    {
      q: "When does Rajyog give results?",
