    intro:
      "Adhi Rajyog is a powerful yoga in Vedic astrology that grants mental strength, authority, respect, and leadership qualities. Unlike many Rajyogs that depend on Lagna, this yoga is formed from the Moon chart and highlights inner power and intelligence.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Adhi Rajyog is formed when benefic planets like Jupiter, Venus, or Mercury occupy the 6th, 7th, or 8th houses from the Moon. These planets strengthen the Moon and create a commanding mental presence.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Since Adhi Rajyog is entirely Moon-based, Moon Rashi plays a critical role. A strong Moon ensures emotional stability, decision-making ability, and confidence required for leadership and responsibility.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Adhi Rajyog tool analyzes benefic planet placements in relation to the Moon using classical Parashari astrology rules. It checks planetary strength, benefic nature, and afflictions before confirming the yoga.",

      "Identifies authentic Adhi Rajyog in kundali",
      "Shows mental strength, authority, and leadership potential",

      "Strictly follows classical Vedic astrology principles",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Adhi Rajyog gives results through mental maturity rather than sudden fame. Its benefits are most visible during the dasha periods of the benefic planets forming the yoga.",
