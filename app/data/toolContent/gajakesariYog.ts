    intro:
      "Gajakesari Yog is one of the most well-known and respected yogas in Vedic astrology. It is formed by the relationship between Moon and Jupiter and is associated with intelligence, wisdom, reputation, and stability in life. However, its strength depends on several supporting factors.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Gajakesari Yog is formed when Jupiter is placed in a Kendra (1st, 4th, 7th, or 10th house) from the Moon. The Moon represents the mind and emotions, while Jupiter signifies wisdom, knowledge, and expansion. Their connection creates balance between intellect and emotional stability.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Since Gajakesari Yog is directly related to the Moon, its evaluation must be done carefully from the Moon chart. Affliction to Moon or Jupiter, weak planetary strength, or unfavorable dashas can reduce the effectiveness of this yoga.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Gajakesari Yog tool checks the positional relationship between Moon and Jupiter, evaluates their dignity, strength, and afflictions, and determines whether a genuine and effective Gajakesari Yog exists in the birth chart.",

    benefits: [
      "Identifies authentic Gajakesari Yog formation",
      "Avoids false or exaggerated yoga claims",
      "Helps understand intelligence and growth potential",
      "Useful for career, reputation, and mental stability analysis",
      "Based on classical Vedic astrology principles",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Gajakesari Yog does not automatically make a person wealthy or famous. Its results unfold gradually and are strongly influenced by planetary strength, aspects, and dasha timing rather than mere positional presence.",
