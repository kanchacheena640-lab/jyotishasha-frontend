    intro:
      "Rajya Sambandh Yog is a classical Vedic astrology concept that indicates connection with authority, administration, leadership, or influential positions. This yoga is formed through specific relationships between key house lords and planets rather than a single fixed combination.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Rajya Sambandh refers to meaningful planetary associations involving Kendra lords (especially the 10th house), Lagna lord, and benefic planets like Sun or Jupiter. These relationships reflect the native’s ability to gain recognition, responsibility, and societal influence.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "While Rajya Sambandh Yog is primarily judged from the Lagna chart, the Moon chart shows how comfortably a person handles authority and responsibility. Emotional instability can weaken the expression of this yoga even when combinations are present.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Rajya Sambandh Yog tool analyzes planetary relationships involving Lagna lord, 10th lord, and key authority indicators. It checks conjunctions, mutual aspects, and exchanges to identify genuine Rajya Sambandh formations according to Parashari principles.",

    benefits: [
      "Identifies planetary combinations related to authority and status",
      "Helps understand leadership and administrative potential",
      "Avoids exaggerated or misleading Rajyog claims",
      "Useful for career, government, and management analysis",
      "Based strictly on classical Vedic astrology logic",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Rajya Sambandh Yog does not guarantee political power or high office by itself. Its results depend on planetary strength, dignity, dasha timing, and the native’s effort. Often, it shows gradual rise rather than sudden authority.",

      q: "Is Rajya Sambandh Yog the same as Rajyog?",
      a: "No. Rajya Sambandh Yog focuses on planetary relationships indicating authority, while Rajyog is a broader category involving Kendra–Trikona lord combinations.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does Rajya Sambandh Yog indicate government jobs?",
      a: "It can support authority or administrative roles, but confirmation requires support from the 6th, 10th houses, Sun, and dasha periods.",
    },
    {
      q: "When does Rajya Sambandh Yog give results?",
      a: "Results generally appear during the dasha or antardasha of planets involved in the Sambandh, provided they are strong and well-placed.",
