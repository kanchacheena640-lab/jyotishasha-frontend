    intro:
      "Many people are confused about their exact Rashi because it cannot be calculated accurately using only the date of birth. In Vedic astrology, Rashi is determined by the Moon’s precise position at the time of birth, which requires correct date, time, and place details.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Rashi refers to the zodiac sign occupied by the Moon at the exact moment of birth. It is also called Moon Sign or Chandra Rashi. In classical Vedic astrology, most predictions, remedies, and horoscope interpretations are primarily based on Moon Rashi rather than the Sun sign.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "Moon Rashi represents the mind, emotions, behavioral patterns, and subconscious tendencies of a person. Daily horoscope readings, emotional compatibility, marriage matching, and many astrological remedies are interpreted mainly through the Moon Rashi.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Rashi Finder uses advanced astronomical calculations to determine the Moon’s exact longitude at the time of birth. By processing your date, time, and place of birth, the tool accurately identifies your Moon Rashi according to traditional Vedic astrology principles.",

    benefits: [
      "Accurately determine your true Moon Rashi",
      "Understand horoscope predictions with better clarity",
      "Useful for marriage compatibility and relationship analysis",
      "Helps in selecting appropriate gemstones and remedies",
      "Provides a reliable base for further kundali analysis",
    ],

    sunVsMoonRashi:
      "Sun Sign astrology, commonly used in Western astrology, is based only on the date of birth. Vedic astrology gives greater importance to Moon Rashi because it reflects emotional responses and real-life experiences more precisely. Your Sun Sign and Moon Rashi can often be different.",

      q: "Can I find my Rashi using only my date of birth?",
      a: "Only an approximate Sun Sign can be identified using date of birth alone. To calculate the exact Moon Rashi, date, time, and place of birth are required.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why is Moon Rashi important in Vedic astrology?",
      a: "Moon Rashi represents the mind and emotional nature and is therefore considered more important for daily predictions, compatibility analysis, and remedies in Vedic astrology.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can Moon Rashi and Sun Sign be different?",
      a: "Yes, Moon Rashi and Sun Sign are often different because they are calculated using different planetary positions.",
