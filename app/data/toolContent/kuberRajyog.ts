    intro:
      "Kuber Rajyog is a powerful wealth-giving yoga in Vedic astrology associated with accumulation of money, savings, and long-term financial stability. It reflects the blessings of Lord Kuber, the deity of wealth.",

    whatIsRashi:
      "Kuber Rajyog is formed when the lords of the 2nd house (wealth, savings) and the 11th house (income, gains) are strong and favorably placed, often in mutual relationship or supported by benefic planets. This combination strengthens financial growth.",

    whyMoonRashiImportant:
      "The Moon chart shows emotional discipline and spending habits. A stable Moon helps preserve wealth, manage resources wisely, and benefit fully from Kuber Rajyog.",

    howToolWorks:
      "The Jyotishasha Kuber Rajyog tool analyzes the strength, placement, and inter-relationship of the 2nd and 11th house lords using classical Parashari astrology rules. It also checks benefic support and planetary afflictions before confirming the yoga.",
